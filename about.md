Hello.

I am an AI Research Engineer in the [Multispeech](https://www.inria.fr/en/multispeech) team at INRIA Lorraine in Nancy (France).
I am currently working on the [REAVISE project](https://msaadeghii.github.io/projects/) (Robust and Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement) using Deep Generative Models with Researcher [Mostafa Sadeghi](https://msaadeghii.github.io/), Associate Professor [Romain Serizel](https://members.loria.fr/RSerizel/) and PhD Student [Jean-Eudes Ayilo](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jeaneudesayilo).

I did internships on Unsupervised Learning for Driving Interactions Classification at the [Center for Robotics](https://www.caor.minesparis.psl.eu/) (Mines Paris-Tech) and [Deep Reinforcment Learning on Atari games](https://medium.com/@mboungoucolombe/playing-atari-games-with-deep-reinforcement-learning-and-attention-d83312fe4f29) and previously worked as a Software Engineer.

I did a Master's in [Data Science, AI and Machine Learning](https://www.hh.se/english/education/programmes/masters-programme-in-information-technology---data-science-ai-and-machine-learning.html) at Halmstad University (Sweden) and a Master's in Electronics and Telecommunications at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Limoges (ENSIL, France).
