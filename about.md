# something about me
Colombe M'Boungou

I am an AI Research Engineer in the Multispeech team ant Inria Lorraine in Nancy (France).
I am currently working on the REAVISE project (Robust and Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement) using Deep Generative Models with Researcher Mostafa Sadeghi and PhD Jean-Eudes Ayilo.

I did a Master's in Data Science, AI and Machine Learning at Halmstad University (Sweden) and a Master's in Electronics and Telecommunications at the ENSIL (Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Limoges, France).
